An\nuncertain and fluctuating return implies risk to the\ninvestors. The problem of uncertainty renders profit\nmaximisation unsuitable as an operational criterion\nfor financial decision-making, as it values only the\n\namount of benefits generated and gives no value to\nthe extent of uncertainty of the future returns.\n\n4) Impact on Social Welfare: Increased profits may\noften lead to the organisation producing such products\nor services which may not be beneficial and useful to\nthe society at large. Thus, such objective may\nsometimes fail to optimise social welfare.\n\nIgnores Financing and Dividend Aspects: Another\nlimitation of the profit maximisation objective is that\nthe effects of financing and dividend decision areas on\nmarket price of shares are often ignored, while\npursuing the objective of profit maximisation.\n\nNn\nwm\n\n6) Change in Organisation Structure: Earlier, an\nowner used to manage the business alone because at\nthat time the competition was too less.

The goal of wealth\nmaximisation is the widely accepted goal of the\nbusiness, as it reconciles the varied, often conflicting,\ninterest of the stakeholders. Also, it is free from the\nlimitations that other objectives are faced with.\n\nAccording to Ezra Solomon, wealth maximisation\ngoal is \u201cThe gross present worth of a course of action is\nequal to the capitalised value of the flow of future\nexpected benefits, discounted (or capitalised) at a rate\nwhich reflects the uncertainty or certainty.

Profit Maximisation\n\nProfit maximisation Is the traditional and narrow\napproach. As per traditional theories, maximisation of\nprofit is considered to be the sole objective of a\nbusiness organisation. This theory is also called as\ncashing per share maximisation. As per the\nTequirement of a firm, the product price and output are\nplaced under competition to maximise profit. Profit\nmaximisation is said to be the maximisation of returns\nby a firm in terms of monetary resources and increasing\nthe earnings per share of the shareholders. Firms often\nselect investment Proposals, which suit their profit\nmaximisation criterion. A firm selects only those\ninvestment projects which provide excess profit and\nreject projects which provide comparatively less profit.\nMaximising profit by a firm is often influenced by the\ninput-output relationship, where firms tend to lower\ntheir cost of capital and tty to achieve maximum profit\nand shareholders\u2019 wealth maximisation. Thus, with the\nright selection of project, the firm can maximise its\nproductivity and efficiency in the operational activities.\n\n1.1.7.1. Features of Profit Maximisation\n\nProfit is one of the most Significant measures for\n\nassessing the efficiency of any business or economic\n\nactivity. Survival and growth of a business concern also\ndepends on its profit earning capacity. According to the\ntraditional theories, profit maximisation is the sole\nobjective of a business concern. Some of the salient\nfeatures of profit maximisation objective are as follows:\n\n1) Profit maximisation is related to the maximisation\nof earnings per share of a firm.\n\n2) Increase in profitability is one of the foremost\nconcerns of every business organisation and thus\ninvolves various procedures and methods to\nmaximise profits.\n\n3) Profit is one of the benchmarks of operational\nefficiency, survival and well-being of a business\norganisation, as it reflects its business decisions\nand policies.\n\n4) The objective of profit maximisation minimises the\nrisk and uncertainty factors in business decisions and\noperations.\n\n1.1.7.2. Arguments in Favour of Profit Maximisation\n\nSome of the arguments in favour of the objective of\n\nprofit maximisation are as follows:\n\n1) Measure of Financial Stability: Profitability of a\nfirm is an important indicator of its financial\nstability as well as economic well-being.\n\n13\n\n2) Optimum Utilisation of Funds: Profit\nmaximisation in a firm, leads to proper and\nefficient channelisation and utilisation of surplus\nfunds for productive business operations and other\neconomic activities.\n\n3) Promotes Socio-Economic Welfare: Increased\nprofit, promotes socio-economic welfare of various\nstakeholders associated with the firm. It aids in\nshareholders\u2019 wealth maximisation, increased\nincentives and benefits to employees, better and\nimproved products to customers, employment\ngeneration, etc.\n\n4) Retained Earnings: Retained profit acts as a major\nsource of long-term finance for a company.\nRetained earnings with a low cost of capital, can be\nutilised for the acquisition of fixed assets,\nexpansion and modernisation projects of a firm.\nThus, outside funding is not required.\n\n5) Increases Competitiveness: Maximisation of\nprofit by a firm helps it to sustain competition from\nits competitors. With increased profits, a firm is\nmore capable to sustain its growth and development\namongst severe competition through product\ndevelopment, market development and gaining\nmarket share.\n\n6) Decision-Making: Increased profitability\nStrengthens the foundation of sound managerial\ndecision-making and also helps to solve agency\nissues in an organisation, through optimum\nutilisation of funds for business expansion as well\nas increased returns to shareholders.\n\n7) Desire for Controls; When the company earns\nhuge profit, the entty of the shareholders is\nrestricted, subject to internal use of funds for\nexpansion and modernisation. And this. in turn,\nleads to full control of the company to the existing\nshareholders.\n\n1.1.7.3. Limitations of Profit Maximisation\n\nHowever, the objective of profit maximisation has been\n\nquestioned and criticised on several grounds. Some of\n\nthe limitations that are associated with the objective of\nprofit maximisation are as follows:\n\n1) Ambiguity: The complexity with profit maximisation\ncriterion for financial decision-making is that the term\nprofit is an ambiguous and confusing concept. It has\nno specific implication. It is open to different\nunderstanding by different individuals. For example,\nprofit may be short-term or long-term; it may be total\nprofit or rate of profit margin; profit after tax or profit\nbefore tax; return on capital employed or assets or\nreturn on equity, Thus, as an objective of profit\nmaximisation, the issue arises as to which variant of\nprofit a business concern should try to maximise,\n\n",
    "D:/Final Year Project/Text/images\\WhatsApp Image 2025-04-18 at 11.21.06_504ea6e4.jpg": "Introduction to Financial Management (Unit 1)\n\nUnit 1\n\nIntroduction to Financial Management\n\n1.1.1.\n\nIntroduction to Finance\n\nAmongst various functions of business, financial\nfunction is one of the most significant functions. It is\nthe central point of all the business activities. This\nfunction cannot be ignored, substituted or removed by a\nbusiness enterprise, as the lack of finance may prove to\nbe disastrous and may even lead to its closure. The\ndemand for finance is on-going and uninterrupted\nduring the entire lifetime of a company.\n\nThere are three basic approaches regarding the concept of\n\nfinancial functions in a business, which are as follows:\n\n1) According to the first approach, the finance function\nis restricted to provide finance required by a company\non favourable terms and conditions, keeping in view\nits objectives. The underlying presumptions of this\napproach are:\n\ni) Demand for finance is created separately out of\nexpenditure decisions taken within a business,\nand\n\nii) The finance manager's job is to procure\nfinances at optimum level at the lowest cost.\n\n2) Under the second approach, the basic premise is\nthat the finance function is broad-based and related\nto each and every activity taking place in a\nbusiness. However, the above premise appears to\nbe misplaced, as finance function is not as broad-\nbased as is made to appear under this approach.\n\n3) The third approach (which is a balanced one and more\nacceptable) considers finance function as raising the\nfunds and their effective application in the business.\nThe concemed officials of a company have a three-\nfold responsibility on their shoulders, vizZ.:\ni) Forecasting an appropriate level of the\ncompany\u2019s fund requirements,\n\nii) Taking a decision about the best option\navailable for raising funds, and\n\niii) Placing the funds so raised to their optimal use\nin an efficient manner.\n\n1.1.2. Meaning & Definition of Finance\nFinance is the backbone of any business. A business\nwould not be able to run without finance and may get\ndeceased, Finance is basically the art and science of\n\nmanaging monetary resources of a business concem and is\nextremely crucial for the survival of a business entity.\nFinance plays an important role, right from the generation\nof the business idea to its day-to-day functioning and upto\nthe liquidation stage of a business. Finance aids in\nprocurement of various resources such as raw materials,\nmachinery and equipment, human resources etc., and\nhelps to maintain the smooth flow of business operations.\nThus, an efficient and healthy financial management\nsystem in an organisation is essential.\n\nThe term \u2018Finance\u2019 has been defined in various ways by\ndifferent schools of thought. Basically, the term finance\nrevolves around the management of money or financial\nresources of a business enterprise. The discipline of\nfinance is concerned with the sources, allocation,\napplication and usage of money by a business entity for\nmaximising its returns and stakeholder\u2019s satisfaction.\n\nAccording to F.W. Paish, \u201cFinance may be defined as\nthe position of money at the time it is wanted\u201d.\n\nAccording to John J. Hampton, \u201cThe term finance\ncan be defined as the management of the flows of\nmoney through an organisation, whether it will be a\ncorporation, school, bank or government agency\u201d.\n\nAccording to Howard and Upton, \u201cFinance may be\ndefined as that administrative area or set of\nadministrative functions in an organisation which\nrelates with the arrangement of each debit and credit so\nthat the organisation may have the means to carry out\nthe objectives as satisfactorily as possible\u201d.\n\n1.1.3. Classification of Finance\nFinance as a discipline has been divided into four major\ncategories:\n\nClassification of Finance |\n\nPublic Finance\n\nPrivate Finance\n\nInstitutional Finance\nInternational Finance\n\n1) Public Finance: This branch of finance is concemed\nwith analysis of receipts and disbursal of funds at\nvarious government levels including local government,\nstate government and central government.\n\n",
